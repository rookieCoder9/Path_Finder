# Path Finder
Welcome to Pathfinding Visualizer! I was fascinated by pathfinding algorithms, and I wanted to visualize them in action. I hope that you enjoy using this application.
Access it here :

I implemented BFS and DFS . Both algorithms have their own advantages. But DFS is faster sometimes while sometimes BFS dominates . 
This project have been developed using : JS , HTML and CSS.

Hope You Would Love It :)
